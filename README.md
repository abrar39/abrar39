**Data Driven Maintenance | Machine Learning | Equipment Reliability**

**Hi!** ðŸ‘‹

Machine learning is transforming the industry. I look for opportunities to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of industrial processes through data driven decision making.
Reducing maintenance related costs lead to improved bottom line. Therefore, I am specially interested in how ML can be used for timely prediction of machine failures and better planning of maintenance operations.
